        <p> 
            A QR Code is a two-dimensional barcode that is readable by smartphones. It allows to encode over 4000
            characters in a two dimensional barcode. QR Codes may be used to display text to the user, to open a
            URL, save a contact to the address book or to compose text messages. "QR Code" is a registered
            trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.

                in colleges , on paper, as QR codes can be used to provide attendees with a full description of
                the itinerary and bios of speakers.

                code app) to read the message and contact you. As an offshoot, you can generate your own QR
                code with contact details like phone number, have them printed out in stickers, and use them on
                items which you tend to misplace like phones and...pets.
